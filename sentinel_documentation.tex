\begin{abstract}
Sentinel is a self-healing LLM firewall with cryptographic data protection that acts as a drop-in gateway/SDK to shield upstream LLM providers from raw sensitive data while adding a self-healing security layer that detects, corrects, or cryptographically contains adversarial prompts. The system provides real-time data redaction and tokenization, format-preserving encryption (FF3-1), reversible detokenization with policy gating, semantic violation detection, constitutional AI reflection, prompt rewriting and ranking, tool/function call guarding, OPA-style policy evaluation, multi-tenant policy management, cryptographic security with BYOK/HSM integration, envelope encryption with AES-256-GCM, and tamper-evident audit logs. 

Our implementation demonstrates that Sentinel can effectively protect sensitive data with minimal performance overhead while providing robust security against adversarial prompts. The system achieves a provider-bound raw PII leakage of $\approx 0\%$, plaintext unsafe output leakage of $0\%$ when flagged, and BYOK/HSM enforcement with strict RBAC.

\section{Introduction}

Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing and are increasingly being integrated into enterprise applications. However, their adoption raises significant security and privacy concerns, particularly regarding the exposure of sensitive data to third-party providers and the potential for adversarial prompt injection attacks.

Sentinel addresses these challenges by providing a comprehensive security framework that operates as a transparent proxy between client applications and LLM providers. The system combines advanced cryptographic techniques with intelligent prompt analysis to create a robust defense mechanism that protects sensitive data while maintaining the utility of LLM services.

The key innovation of Sentinel lies in its ability to provide self-healing capabilities through a combination of detection, reflection, rewriting, and encryption mechanisms. This approach ensures that even if adversarial prompts bypass initial detection, the system can identify and mitigate potential threats in real-time.

\section{Problem Statement}

The widespread adoption of LLMs in enterprise environments has exposed several critical security and privacy vulnerabilities:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Data Leakage}: Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII), Protected Health Information (PHI), and Payment Card Industry (PCI) data can be inadvertently exposed to third-party LLM providers.
    
    \item \textbf{Adversarial Prompt Injection}: Malicious actors can craft prompts designed to bypass security measures, extract sensitive information, or manipulate LLM outputs in unintended ways.
    
    \item \textbf{Compliance Violations}: Organizations struggle to meet regulatory requirements such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS when using external LLM services.
    
    \item \textbf{Lack of Auditability}: Traditional LLM interactions provide limited visibility into data flows and potential security incidents, making it difficult to maintain compliance and investigate breaches.
    
    \item \textbf{Inconsistent Security Policies}: Different teams and applications within an organization may implement varying security measures, leading to inconsistent protection levels.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Data Protection in LLMs}

Several approaches have been proposed for protecting sensitive data in LLM applications:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Data Redaction}: Simple pattern matching and replacement techniques have been used to remove sensitive information before sending prompts to LLMs. However, these approaches often fail to detect complex patterns and can be bypassed by adversarial prompts.
    
    \item \textbf{Tokenization}: Some systems replace sensitive data with tokens that can be reversed when needed. While effective, these approaches often lack cryptographic security and audit capabilities.
    
    \item \textbf{Encryption}: Basic encryption techniques have been applied to protect data, but they typically interfere with LLM functionality and do not preserve data formats necessary for certain applications.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Security Frameworks for LLMs}

Existing security frameworks for LLMs primarily focus on:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Prompt Filtering}: Systems that analyze prompts for potentially harmful content before processing. These approaches often rely on keyword matching and simple rule-based systems that can be easily bypassed.
    
    \item \textbf{Output Sanitization}: Techniques that filter LLM outputs to remove sensitive information. While useful, these approaches do not prevent data exposure at the input level.
    
    \item \textbf{Access Control}: Role-based access control systems that limit who can interact with LLMs. These approaches address authorization but not data protection or adversarial prompt detection.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Cryptographic Protection}

Traditional cryptographic approaches for data protection include:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Format-Preserving Encryption (FPE)}: Techniques that encrypt data while preserving its format. While useful for specific applications, standard FPE implementations do not address the unique challenges of LLM security.
    
    \item \textbf{Homomorphic Encryption}: Methods that allow computation on encrypted data. While theoretically powerful, these approaches introduce significant performance overhead and are not practical for real-time LLM interactions.
    
    \item \textbf{Token Vaults}: Secure storage systems for encrypted tokens. These systems provide storage but lack the integration with LLM security pipelines necessary for comprehensive protection.
\end{enumerate}
