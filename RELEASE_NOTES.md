# Sentinel + CipherMesh v0.1.0

## Initial Public Release

We're excited to announce the initial public release of Sentinel + CipherMesh, a self-healing LLM firewall with cryptographic data protection!

## What is Sentinel + CipherMesh?

Sentinel is a drop-in gateway/SDK that shields upstream LLM providers from raw sensitive data while adding a self-healing security layer that detects, corrects, or cryptographically contains adversarial prompts.

CipherMesh provides PII/tokenization and cryptographic protection layers.
