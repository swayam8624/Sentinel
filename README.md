## Overview

Sentinel is a drop-in gateway/SDK that shields upstream LLM providers from raw sensitive data while adding a self-healing security layer that detects, corrects, or cryptographically contains adversarial prompts.

CipherMesh provides PII/tokenization and cryptographic protection layers.

## Key Features

### üîê Data Protection

- Real-time data redaction/tokenization
- Format-preserving encryption (FF3-1)
- Reversible detokenization with policy gating
- Multi-language PII detection

### üõ°Ô∏è Self-Healing Security

- Semantic violation detection
- Constitutional AI reflection
- Prompt rewriting and ranking
- Tool/function call guarding

### üîÑ Provider Agnostic

- Adapters for OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, Hugging Face, Ollama
- Reverse proxy mode with provider-compatible endpoints
- SDK middleware for Python and Node.js
- Streaming support with mid-stream inspection

### ‚öôÔ∏è Policy Engine

- OPA-style policy evaluation
- Policy versioning and canary deployments
- Multi-tenant policy management
- Audit trails and compliance reporting

### üîê Cryptographic Security

- BYOK/HSM integration
- Envelope encryption with AES-256-GCM
- HKDF-SHA-512 key derivation
- Tamper-evident audit logs

## Components

- **Sentinel Gateway**: Core security pipeline with detection, reflection, rewriting, and encryption capabilities
- **CipherMesh**: Data detection and redaction engine with reversible tokenization
- **Policy Engine**: OPA-style policy evaluation system
- **Crypto Vault**: Key management and encryption services
- **Admin Console**: Policy, key, and tenant management interface
