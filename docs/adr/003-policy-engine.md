# Policy Engine for Sentinel + CipherMesh

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to implement a policy engine that can:

1. Evaluate data classification and handling rules
2. Support tenant-specific policies
3. Enable versioning and canary deployments
4. Provide audit trails for policy decisions
5. Integrate with existing policy frameworks (OPA)
6. Support both declarative and programmatic policy definition

We evaluated several approaches:

- Custom policy engine implementation
- Integration with Open Policy Agent (OPA)
- Integration with other policy frameworks (Cedar, Kyverno)
- Rule engine approach (Drools, Easy Rules)

## Decision

We will implement a **hybrid policy engine** that:

1. **Core Engine**: Use Open Policy Agent (OPA) as the foundational policy engine due to its:

   - Mature ecosystem and community
   - Rego language for policy definition
   - Strong audit and tracing capabilities
   - Wide industry adoption

2. **Extensions**: Build custom extensions for:

   - Tenant isolation and scoping
   - Policy versioning and canary deployments
   - Integration with our data models and types
   - Performance optimizations for our specific use cases

3. **Policy Structure**:

   - YAML/JSON for policy definition
   - Rego for complex logic
   - Built-in functions for common operations (PII detection, etc.)
   - Template system for common policy patterns

4. **Deployment**:
   - Embedded mode for SDKs
   - Service mode for gateway deployments
   - Caching layer for performance

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- Leverages a proven, industry-standard policy engine
- Reduces development time and risk
- Benefits from OPA's ecosystem and tooling
- Supports both simple and complex policy definitions
- Enables policy testing and simulation
- Provides clear audit trails for policy decisions

### Negative Consequences

- Dependency on external policy engine
- Learning curve for Rego language
- Potential performance overhead for simple policies
- Need to maintain custom extensions
- Complexity in multi-tenant policy management
