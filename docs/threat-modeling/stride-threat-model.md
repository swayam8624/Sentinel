# STRIDE Threat Model for Sentinel + CipherMesh

## Overview

This document outlines the STRIDE threat model for Sentinel + CipherMesh, identifying potential threats and their mitigations across the system architecture.

## STRIDE Categories

### 1. Spoofing

- Use JWT tokens for client authentication to the gateway
- Implement strong authentication (MFA) for admin console access
- Digitally sign all audit logs with non-repudiation controls
- Validate certificates for all external connections

### 2. Tampering

**Threat:** Unauthorized modification of data, code, or system configurations.

**Potential Attack Vectors:**

### 5. Denial of Service (DoS)

**Threat:** Making the system unavailable to legitimate users.

**Potential Attack Vectors:**

### 6. Elevation of Privilege

**Threat:** Unauthorized users gaining higher privileges than intended.

**Potential Attack Vectors:**

- Escalation to admin privileges
- Bypassing security controls
- Accessing other tenants' data
- Executing unauthorized policies
- Modifying system configurations

**Mitigations:**

- Implement strict RBAC with least privilege
- Use break-glass tracking for privilege escalation
- Implement tenant isolation at the data layer
- Enforce policy evaluation for all actions
- Implement privilege separation in code execution
- Regularly audit access controls and permissions
- Use just-in-time access for administrative functions
