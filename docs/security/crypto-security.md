# Cryptographic Security in Sentinel

This document details how Sentinel's cryptographic implementations provide protection against all types of cryptographic attacks, ensuring the highest level of enterprise-grade security.

## Overview

Sentinel implements a comprehensive suite of cryptographic components designed to protect against a wide range of attacks while maintaining high performance and usability. The system follows security best practices and cryptographic standards to ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.

## Protection Against Cryptographic Attacks

### 1. Side-Channel Attacks

**Protection Mechanisms:**

- **Constant-time Operations**: Critical cryptographic operations are implemented to execute in constant time, preventing timing-based side-channel attacks
- **Secure Memory Handling**: Sensitive data is handled in secure memory regions with proper cleanup
- **Randomization**: Nonces and salts are generated using cryptographically secure random number generators

**Implementation Details:**

- HKDF implementation uses standard library functions that are resistant to timing attacks
- AES-GCM operations use hardware-accelerated implementations when available
- Memory containing sensitive keys is zeroed after use

### 2. Replay Attacks

**Protection Mechanisms:**

- **Nonce Uniqueness Enforcement**: The nonce management system ensures each nonce is used only once within its TTL
- **Timestamp-based Expiration**: All cryptographic tokens and keys have expiration times
- **Sequence Number Validation**: Where applicable, sequence numbers prevent replay of old messages

**Implementation Details:**

- NonceManager tracks all used nonces with timestamps
- Automatic cleanup of expired nonces prevents memory exhaustion
- Token Vault enforces TTL for all stored secrets

### 3. Brute Force Attacks

**Protection Mechanisms:**

- **Strong Key Derivation**: HKDF-SHA-512 provides strong key derivation with high entropy
- **AES-256 Encryption**: Military-grade encryption for all sensitive data
- **Secure Random Number Generation**: All random values use cryptographically secure generators

**Implementation Details:**

- HKDF uses SHA-512 hash function for maximum security
- KeyManager generates 256-bit keys for AES encryption
- All random values use `crypto/rand` package for cryptographic security

### 4. Man-in-the-Middle Attacks

**Protection Mechanisms:**

- **Authenticated Encryption**: AES-GCM provides both confidentiality and authenticity
- **Tamper-Evident Logs**: Merkle trees detect any modification to audit logs
- **Secure Key Exchange**: Envelope encryption pattern protects key exchange

**Implementation Details:**

- All data encryption uses AES-GCM authenticated encryption
- Merkle tree root hashes are stored securely and verified regularly
- Data keys are encrypted with master keys before transmission

### 5. Data Integrity Attacks

**Protection Mechanisms:**

- **Cryptographic Hashing**: SHA-256 provides strong hashing for data integrity
- **Merkle Tree Verification**: Hierarchical verification of log integrity
- **Authenticated Encryption**: AES-GCM provides built-in integrity checking

**Implementation Details:**

- SHA-256 is used for all hashing operations
- Merkle trees provide efficient verification of large datasets
- GCM mode provides both encryption and authentication tags

### 6. Key Management Attacks

**Protection Mechanisms:**

- **Envelope Encryption**: Data keys are encrypted with master keys
- **Key Rotation**: Regular key rotation prevents long-term key exposure
- **Secure Key Storage**: Keys are stored in secure environments

**Implementation Details:**

- KeyManager implements envelope encryption pattern
- Master keys are stored separately from data keys
- Cloud KMS integrations provide hardware security modules
