# Sentinel + CipherMesh Test Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Sentinel + CipherMesh project, covering unit tests, integration tests, and manual tests to ensure the system meets all security, performance, and functionality requirements.

## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests

- Crypto component tests (HKDF, nonce, FPE, Merkle trees, vault)
- Data detection tests (regex patterns, confidence scoring)
- Security pipeline tests (violation detection, reflection, rewriting)
- Adapter tests (OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, HF, Ollama)
- Policy engine tests (OPA integration, versioning)

### 2. Integration Tests

- End-to-end data flow (detection → redaction → encryption → LLM → response)
- Multi-tenant isolation tests
- Streaming support tests
- Proxy integration tests
- KMS integration tests (AWS, GCP, Azure)

### 3. Security Tests

- Penetration testing
- Cryptographic implementation validation
- Tamper detection tests
- RBAC enforcement tests
- Audit log integrity tests

### 4. Performance Tests

- Latency measurements (p50, p95, p99)
- Throughput testing (req/s per pod)
- Resource utilization (CPU, memory)
- Stress testing under load

### 5. Manual Tests

- UI/UX validation for admin console
- Policy creation and management workflows
- Tenant onboarding processes
- Incident response procedures

## Test Environment

- Go 1.23+
- Docker for containerized services
- Kubernetes for deployment testing
- Cloud KMS services (AWS, GCP, Azure) for integration tests

## Test Execution

Tests will be executed using the Go testing framework with coverage reporting.
